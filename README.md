DText (For curious mind, it is DrawableText) is a minimal Android Library that creates beautiful drawable from a string. You can use it from anywhere from your project. By default it uses pixels as a unit of measurement. But you can use sp (for font specifics) or dp (for height/width specifics) by passing a 'context' to the builder.
